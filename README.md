### Shipping Labels
Shipping Labels is a simple shipping label generator written in TypeScript. It retrieves information from a form, then draws it on a shipping label template and downloads it on the user's computer. The project uses Express for creating the server and Jimp for image manipulation. 

### Installation 
Open the environment file located in the root folder, fill out the necessary fields and install all necessary packages using `npm install`. After that, simply run the project.
